This project is an example that was built for my Assembly class assignment to solve n queen problem. The project is a sample of code that shows how to do the following:
* Getting input from keyboard
* Control flow and branching
* Procedures and functions
* Loading bitmap picture

## How to run the project
* Clone this project
* Just double-click the file MAIN.EXE, but you will need to run it on an x86 CPU (I developed it on Windows XP 32-bit using TASM: Turbo Assembler).

## How to tweak this project
You can try to convert the project to other assembler. Have fun coding guys ^^
